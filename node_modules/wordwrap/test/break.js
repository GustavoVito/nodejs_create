e will call into that class to allow it to perform
             application-specific preloads (such as loading a shared library). Therefore,
             spawning from the Application Zygote will typically reduce the service
             launch time and reduce its memory usage. The downside of using this flag
             is that you will have an additional process (the app zygote itself) that
             is taking up memory. Whether actual memory usage is improved therefore strongly
             depends on the number of isolated services that an application starts,
             and how much memory those services save by preloading and sharing memory with
             the app zygote. Therefore, it is recommended to measure memory usage under
             typical workloads to determine whether it makes sense to use thi
