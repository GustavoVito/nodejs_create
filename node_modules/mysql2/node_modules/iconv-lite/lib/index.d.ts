function Start-ChocolateyProcessAsAdmin {
<#
.SYNOPSIS
**NOTE:** Administrative Access Required.

Runs a process with administrative privileges. If `-ExeToRun` is not
specified, it is run with PowerShell.

.NOTES
This command will assert UAC/Admin privileges on the machine.

Starting in 0.9.10, will automatically call Set-PowerShellExitCode to
set the package exit code in the following ways:

- 4 if the binary turns out to be a text file.
- The same exit code returned from the process that is run. If a 3010 is returned, it will set 3010 for the package.
